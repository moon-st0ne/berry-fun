Berry Fun!
==========
Berry Fun! is a small(ish) addon for Cobblemon which adds various comestibles made from Cobblemon's many inedible berries. Since the berries are based on real-life fruits (and, in one case, cockleburr seed pods?), I decided to make the items available per-berry vary depending on what their real-life counterparts are made into.

Expect to find juices, pies or cakes, pastries or tarts, teas or wines, breads and other baked goods, ice creams and candies, and of course jellies and jams.

I have taken some creative liberties with a couple of the berries given their real-world purpose. For example, the Occa berry is based on a cacao pod.
Minecraft already has Cocoa Beans, so it would be silly to call ice cream made with Occa berries "chocolate ice cream." I call it "occalate ice cream."
What's the difference between chocolate and occalate? Enough questions. Eat the ice cream.
